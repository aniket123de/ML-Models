## Getting Started
To get started with any of the models:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aniket123de/ML-Models.git
   ```
2. Open the desired Jupyter Notebook in Google Colab or your local environment.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to train or evaluate the model.

## Models Included
### 1. Logistic Regression
- **Fake News Prediction**: Classifies news articles as real or fake.
- **Rock vs Mine Classification**: Differentiates between rocks and mines based on sonar data.

### 2. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- **Diabetes Prediction**: Predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on medical data.
- **Loan Status Prediction**: Determines loan approval status based on applicant data.

### 3. XGBoost Regressor (XGBR)
- **House Price Prediction**: Predicts house prices based on various features.

## Contributing
